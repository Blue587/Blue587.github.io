each Pokémon has a block of 0xE0 bytes

from 0x0 to 0xF except 0xD - each bit represents whether a TM/HM can be learned or not
when reading each bit of each byte from the least significant bit, the bits are in the same order as the TMs section of the items list (https://pastebin.com/Dw1n2MAh)

0xD - unknown. (always 00s?)

from 0x10 to 0x43 - every move learned by leveling up, represented by 2 bytes each
from 0x44 to 0x5D - levels at which each move is learned. 1 byte for each move

0x5E and 0x5F - unknown (always 00?)

0x60 - one byte deciding which tiles a Pokémon can stand on:
bit 0 - unknown. ground?
bit 1 - if active, the Pokémon can float over tiles
bit 2 - if active, the Pokémon can walk through walls tiles
bit 3 - if active, the Pokémon can walk over lava tiles
bit 4 - if active, the Pokémon can walk over water tiles
bit 5 - unknown.
bit 6 - unknown.
bit 7 - unknown.

0x64 and 0x65 - Pokédex Number
0x66 - unknown. seems to be the same value + 1 for shinies. seems to be related to the Pokémon's ID. similar to 0x66/0x67 in gti?
0x6a - unknown. different for shinies? (always C0 for shinies?)
0x6b - unknown. different for shinies? (always FF for shinies?)
0x6c - unknown. different for shinies? (always C0 for shinies?)


0x72 - unknown
0x74 - base HP
0x76 - base attack
0x78 - base sp attack
0x7a - base defense
0x7c - base sp defense
0x7e - base speed
0x80 - unknown. maybe starting level (and so always 1). what would be the point of that though?

0x84 - evolutionary line ID, used for experience.bin


0x90 - ability 1
0x91 - ability 2
0x92 - hidden ability
0x93 - type 1
0x94 - type 2
0x98 - unknown. seems to be 1 for most Mega Evolutions, but it doesn't apply to all of them (see Altaria, Rayquaza and more)
0x9a - unknown. different for (some? see Butterfree) shinies?
from 0x9b to 0xae - in Mankey's entry (0x43), this is a string that reads "UNLOCK_FRIEND_MANKII"
